# Traffic Sign Detection in Road Videos
A simple program created to automatically apply rectangles and the traffic signs in a given video. This was made as a project for Digital Image Processing class.

# Main idea of the program
1. Figure out the color threshold to mask on and detect the traffic signs.

2. Use the real traffic signs to get a template for the detection method.

3. Use a loop to go through each frame and look for the traffic signs

4. Create a function to find and verify the signs using the template.
